### EDUCATION
**University of Toronto**,  Toronto, ON  
Ph.D., [Biological and Organic Chemistry](https://www.chemistry.utoronto.ca/research/biological-and-organic-chemistry)  
**Supervisor**: [Dr. Deborah Zamble](http://biochemistry.utoronto.ca/person/deborah-b-zamble/)  
**Thesis**: [Metal Specificity in [NiFe] Hydrogenase Maturation Proteins](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/69030)

**St. Francis Xavier University**, Antigonish, NS  
B.Sc., Chemistry  
**Supervisor**: [Dr. Truis Smith-Palmer](https://www2.mystfx.ca/chemistry/truis-smith-palmer)  
**Thesis**: "Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy of Microbiological Systems"  

### EXPERIENCE
**Precision Biologic Inc.** (Dartmouth, NS)  
**Research and Development Scientist**  
June 2017 - Present  

Throughout 2017 and 2018, I worked on the design and development of the [CRYOcheck Factor VIII Inhibitor Kit](https://precisionbiologic.com/products/diagnostic-kits/cryocheck-factor-viii-inhibitor-kit), a standardized set of reagents used to quantify inhibitory antibodies in patients with hemophilia A. This involved measuring the the stability, precision, and equivalency of the kit, as well as the effects of common interferents. In early 2019, we received [FDA 510(k) clearance](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K183440) of the kit as a class II medical device, the first successful 510(k) application at PBI in fourteen years.

In parallel, I developed and implemented a comprehensive system for managing the data we produce throughout our device validation work. Results from our instruments are exported, tidied, and analyzed with minimal user interaction. The process is powered by [R, a statistical programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), and replaced a system where data were stored on paper printouts and analyzed in spreadsheets.

I currently work on developing medical devices that rapidly and inexpensively detect lupus anticoagulants in human plasma.

**Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University** (Halifax, NS)  
**Killam Postdoctoral Fellow**  
April 2015 - May 2017

I held a research fellowship in the lab of [Dr. Stephen Bearne](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/chemistry/faculty-staff/our-faculty/stephen-bearne.html) in the Department of Biochemistry. The Bearne Lab deals in fundamental enzymology aiming to understand the relationship between structure, function, and mechanism.

In the first year of my fellowship, I worked on developing a novel methods of inserting NMR-active nuclei into the active site of an enzyme, through a combination of amber stop codon suppression and photocaging.

My second year was spent studying mechanism-based inhibitors of enolase enzymes. We discovered a class of boronate-based molecules that show a slow, tight binding profile to the mandelate racemase. I used multivariate non-linear curve fitting to suss out the different steps in the inhibition mechanism, and demonstrated that one molecule we worked with was the tightest known inhibitor of it's target enzyme.
