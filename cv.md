My name is Colin. I have a biochemistry-ish Ph.D. and I really like the R programming language. I've made a career of poking around in big data sets and telling stories that decision-makers find interesting.

### EXPERIENCE


**Canadian Digital Service** (Remote/Ottawa, ON)<br>
**Senior Advisor, Strategic Data and Reporting**, October 2024 - Present

I currently work at the [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca/). They do really good work in [digital transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation) space. I am helping them organize their data and tell stories about the aforementioned good work.


**Public Services and Procurement Canada** (Remote/Ottawa, ON)  
**Senior Data Scientist**, February 2022 - October 2024  
**Data Scientist**, November 2020 - February 2022

I was the primary data scientist for various incarnations of what was once called the [Pay Administration Branch](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-services-procurement/services/pay-pension/pay-administration/integrated-strategy-human-resources-pay.html). I used the [R programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) to help people understand whether the policies they were implementing were working.

I spent the first half of my tenure at Pay doing short- and medium-term time series modelling, on the scale of weeks to months. These forecasts fed into reporting upwards to the [DM level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_minister_(Canada)) and outwards to [operational units](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-services-procurement/services/pay-pension/pay-administration/pay-centre-resources/about-pay-centre.html). I provided guidance on things like resource determiniation, productivity measurements, and measuring the labour involved in individual pieces of work.

The second half of my time working at Pay, I used [agent-based modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) to simulate the pay system and help forecast the long-term impact of [certain policy and budget decisions](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/phoenix-payroll-civil-servants). Although this was a modelling-heavy project, I also spent a lot of my time explaining my work to smart-but-not-technical people. My contributions were an important part of the Pay Program's budget requests and consistently resulted in favourable funding decisions.

I also spent a lot of time advocating for the adoption of open source software (especially the R ecosystem) for making [analyses reproducible](https://poldrack.github.io/psych-open-science-guide/4_reproducibleanalysis.html). I have a lot of strong opinions on it and would love to talk to you about it! I have presented on the subject many times to many different government audiences, and you can see an example presentation here: [Using R for Reproducible Reporting](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZJkvxSAzuyCLT_QPmDiMKSto27Vmw4MV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105826761141236817793&rtpof=true&sd=true).

**Precision Biologic Inc.** (Dartmouth, NS)  
**Research and Development Scientist**  
June 2017 - November 2020

I helped develop and clear two medical devices:
 * [CryoCheck Factor VIII Inhibitor Kit](https://precisionbiologic.com/products/diagnostic-kits/cryocheck-factor-viii-inhibitor-kit), which detects inhibitory factor VIII antibodies ([K183440](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/K183440.pdf))
 * [CryoCheck Hex LA](https://precisionbiologic.com/products/diagnostic-kits/cryocheck-hex-la), which detects lupus anticoagulant through the neutralization of hexagonal phase phospholipid ([K193556](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K193556.pdf))

**Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University** (Halifax, NS)  
**Killam Postdoctoral Fellow**  
April 2015 - May 2017

I studied mechanism-based inhibitors of enolase enzymes. In one project, I used multivariate non-
linear curve fitting to suss out the different steps in an inhibition mechanism, and demonstrated
that one molecule we worked with was the tightest known inhibitor of it’s target enzyme.
