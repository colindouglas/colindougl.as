### [bcsxp](https://www.github.com/colindouglas/bcsxp)
R an package that cleans up ASCII data from Siemens BCS XP coagulation analyzers.
Written as an exercise in R packages, it works with the majority of assays,
although it struggles with some edge cases. It currently lacks unit tests because
of the lack of publicly available data. If *you* have BCS XP ASCII data that
you'd be willing to share (and release with an appropriate license), please
[contact me](mailto:me@colindougl.as)
