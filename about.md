Colin Douglas is a chemist, data scientist, and normal guy living in
Halifax, Nova Scotia. He uses this vanity domain to house a bunch of his
projects.

# Hobbies
Colin enjoys baseball (playing fantasy, watching real) and spends a lot of time
thinking about how to [best optimize his keeper team](https://www.github.com/colindouglas/fantasy-baseball).
He also [maintains an R package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=retrosheet)
for importing historical baseball data from [retrosheet.org](https://www.retrosheet.org).
The package is used occasionally by baseball statistics nerds and one guy who works
for the [Minnesota Twins](https://www.mlb.com/twins).

Colin loves trivia, especially [Jeopardy](https://colindougl.as/jeopardy). He has
also spent a significant amount of time in the last few months maximizing his
[avocado toast consumption](/real-estate/).


# Career
Colin was awarded a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Toronto in 2015, where he
studied bioinorganic chemistry. He can tell you a lot about how the [nickel gets
into the center of [NiFe]-hydrogenase](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/69030),
although no one ever asks. After graduating, he took up a Killam Postdoctoral
Fellowship at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, performing enzymology
research in the Faculty of Medicine that was secretly math.

Colin currently fulfills the role of Research and Development Scientist at
[Precision Biologic](https://www.precisionbiologic.com/), where he works in
the product development pipeline. He was the lead scientist on the team that
was awarded FDA clearance of the [Factor VIII Inhibitor Kit](https://precisionbiologic.com/products/diagnostic-kits/cryocheck-factor-viii-inhibitor-kit), the first [successful 510(k)](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K183440) at Precision Biologic in fourteen years. He is
currently working on medical devices to rapidly and inexpensively detect lupus
anticoagulants.

At work, Colin enjoys large data sets, tight control ranges, and automating
himself out of a job. You might be interested in his R package [{bcsxp}](https://www.github.com/colindouglas/bcsxp),
which makes it easy to export data from [Siemens BCS XP](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/hemostasis/systems/bcs-xp-system) coagulation analyzers.

# This Site

The page is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on a
[Linode](https://www.linode.com/) running Debian 10. It uses a heavily modified
version of the [Klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise) theme, and
integrates [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
throughout.
